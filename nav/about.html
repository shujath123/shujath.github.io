               “We ought to be about something beyond moving chicken.<br>
               We ought to be a piece of our client’s lives and the networks in which we serve.”<br>
               Our originator, settled on the choice to close on Sundays in 1946<br>
               when he opened his first eatery in Hyderabad,Telangana. Having worked seven days in<br>
               eateries open 24 hours, Truett saw the significance of shutting on Sundays with the<br>
               goal that he and his representatives could set aside one day to rest and love whether<br>
               they pick – a training we maintain today.</p>
